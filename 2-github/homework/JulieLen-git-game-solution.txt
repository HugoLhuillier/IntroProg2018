\i I use the log to find previous commits, and when I have identify the commit I am interest in, here the one with the commit message \'ab\'a0Hello world\'a0\'bb, I only need to remember the 4 first numbers of the commit ID, and type in the following command line: 
\i0 \
\

\f1 \cf2 \cb3 \CocoaLigature0 git log\
git checkout 6402
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 2:
\b0\fs26 \
\

\i I checked the list of branches on GitHub and found the one that as a name which is the riddle: \'91bug\'92. Next I need to type in the following command line: 
\i0 \
\

\f1 git checkout bug
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 3: 
\b0\fs26 \
\

\i In order to look at the revisions of the file cool.cpp I typed: \
\

\f1\i0 git blame cool.cpp\

\f0\i \
And when I saw the modification, I could find the evil Mastermind, and just needed to type: \
\

\f1\i0 git checkout LinusTorvalds2014
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 4: 
\b0\fs26 \
\

\i I found the .gitignore file in my local repo. It was a hidden file but long ago I used a command line that asked my computer to show all hidden files so I could see it and open it. But if it was not the case, I would have typed in : \
\

\f1\i0 ls -a\
open .gitignore
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 5:

\b0 \
\

\i The answer is \'ab\'a0a tree\'a0\'bb. Therefore I type in: \
\

\f1\i0 git checkout tree
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 6: 
\b0\fs26 \
\

\i I needed to input the FILE name into the indicated command, and the FILE was exactly 
\i0 nextclue_input.cpp. 
\i Therefore I just typed: 
\i0 \
\

\f1 ./outputclue.sh nextclue_input.cpp
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 7: 
\b0\fs26 \
\

\f1 git merge code4life
\f0 \
\

\i When I tried this, the shell notified me of the conflict. Now I have to open the 
\i0 nextclue_input.cpp
\i  file in Atom and solve the conflict. In the file, I just combined the two sentences and checked that the code was good. In the end, my nextclue_input.cpp file looked like: \
\

\f2 #include <iostream>\

\f0 \

\f2\i0 using namespace std;\
//Level 9\
int main()\
\{\
    cout << "This file was useless, so I made it better...hope you resolved all your conflicts!!" << endl;\
    return 0;\
\}
\f0 \

\i \
\
Now that I have solved the conflit, I can write : 
\i0 \
\

\f1 git status\
git add .\
git commit -m \'ab\'a0Fix de conflicts\'a0\'bb\
git merge code4life\
./outputclue.sh nextclue_input.cpp\

\f0 \

\b\fs30 Level 8: 
\b0\fs26 \
\

\f1 git checkout mouse\
git log
\f0 \
\

\i Since the previous commits were made by Henry Garcia, I guessed I had to checkout his branch.\
\

\f1\i0 git checkout Henry
\f0 \
\

\b\fs30 Level 9:
\b0\fs26 \
\

\i Since there was a branch and a tag that thad the same name, I changed the tag name from Henry to Henryy, then deleted the tag named Henry, and finally checked out the branch: 
\i0 \
\

\f1 git tag Henryy Henry\
git tag -d Henry\
git checkout Henry\

\f0 \

\i To update the master branch, we need first to configure git to be able to sync with the remote repo, and then to fetch and merge the remote repo: 
\i0 \

\f1 \

\cf4 \cb1 \CocoaLigature1 git remote add upstream https://github.com/drami025/git-game.git\
git remote -v 
\f0 \
\

\i Now that I am sure I have configure a remote repo, I can fetch and merge: \
\

\f1\i0 git fetch upstream\
git checkout master\
git merge upstream/master\
\

\f0\i And that\'92s it !
