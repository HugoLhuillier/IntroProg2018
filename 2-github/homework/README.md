# Github - homework

This homework is based on the [git-game](https://github.com/git-game/git-game).

**Pre-requisite**: the instructions bellow assume that you have already forked IntroProg2018.

_To complete this homework:_

1. Go on the Github page of the [git-game](https://github.com/git-game/git-game)
1. Do the game
1. For each level of the game, save your solution in a `.txt` file named `YOUR-NAME-git-game-solution.txt`
1. Once you are done with the game, put the `.txt` file in this directory (i.e., in `2-github/homework/` on your local clone)
1. Commit and push this `.txt` file to your remote repository these changes (**only the `.txt` file!**)
1. Open a pull request on my repository

_Remember:_ the easier it is for me to understand what you've done, the more points you'll get from this homework!
