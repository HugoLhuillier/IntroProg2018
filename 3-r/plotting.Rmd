## Basic plot vs. `ggplot2`

- `R`'s one of the best programming language for data science, partly due to its plotting capacity
- For quick exploration of data, use base `R`
- To produce publication ready plots, use `ggplot2` - more flexible / plots are easier to customize
```{r, warning = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
require("ggplot2")
require("gcookbook")
```

# Bar charts

## Basics

- Used to display numeric values (y-axis) for different categories (x-axis)
- The y-axis could represent counts (= discrete histogram), or the variable's values
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

<!-- 
plot is made of a sum of two functions

1. what to plot
arguments in ggplot()
  1. the data set; pg_mean is a data frame 
  1. aes() specifies the axis; here, group and weight are two columns from the data set we supplied earlier. pour etre precis, group is a factor, with three values, and three weight associated 

1. how to be plotted 
want a bar chart; will see stat = "identity" later on

NOTE: here, here y-axis = the value, not count
-->

## Discrete vs. continuous $x$-axis

- If the variable plotted on the $x$-axis is continuous, behaves differently  
- Can transform the data via `factor()`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=factor(Time), y=demand)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```
```{r, echo= FALSE, fig.align='center'}
x <- ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
y <- ggplot(BOD, aes(x=factor(Time), y=demand)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 1, ncol = 2, labels = c("continuous","discrete"))
```

<!-- in the data frame BOD, time is clealry a continuous variable. precisely, goes from 1 to 7. 
When x is continuous, instead of having one bar at each actual x value, there is one bar at each possible x value between the minimum and the maximum => hence the 6 even though there's no data for t = 6. t = 6 is dropped when using the x-axis as categorical

when dealing with factors, can do all the things that we learned (remove some factors, re-order them etc.)
-->

## Multi-dimensional bar charts 

- Possibility to add a third variable
```{r, echo = TRUE}
str(cabbage_exp)
```
<!-- (e.g. low income, medium income, and high income, by gender for instance) => for that need a way to differentiate them. best way = color  

wanna plot the weight by date and cultivar that are two categorical variable; gonna use weight in the y axis, date for the x axis, and cultivar as third variable 
-->

## Multi-dimensional bar charts 

- Possibility to add a third variable
- Use `fill` to add the variable, and `dodge` to determine where to put the new bars
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge")
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
```{r, echo= FALSE, fig.align='center'}
x <- ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge")
y <- ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 1, ncol = 2, labels = c("w/ dodge","w/out dodge"))
```


<!-- here, the thrid variable affects what to plot => first function
    dodge contrary has to do with where to plot the variable => second function
    
what's hapenning? by adding fill, we specify an "aesthetics" that tells ggplot to divide the data with an additional category, changing the filling color 
-> other aesthetics, e.g. linestyle = change the linestyles of the bars, or colours, which change the outline. but not very useful in this case ! will be later on though
    -->

## Discrete histograms

- To have counts on the $y$-axis instead of values
```{r, echo = TRUE,fig.align='center'}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut)) + geom_bar()
```

- Pretty much a plot of `table(diamonds$cut)`
- If used a continuous variable instead of discrete one, would end up with a histogram

## Customization

- By default, bar graphs use a dark grey for the bars with no outline 
- Use `fill` and `colour` to specify the color of the bars and the outline 
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightblue", colour="black")
```
<!-- note that clearly the colours have nothing to do with the data we are plotting => go in the second function -->

## Customization

- Can use pre-defined palette
- Find the list [here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/figure/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge", colour="black") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel1")
```

## Customization

- Can also set the color manually 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
upc <- subset(uspopchange, rank(Change)>40)
```
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(upc, aes(x=reorder(Abb, Change), y=Change, fill=Region)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", colour="black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#669933", "#FFCC66"))
```

<!-- looks complicated? it is not!
  
plot is about plotting the 10 US states with the greatest increase in population from 2000 to 2010, differentiting them by state! 
  
  1. differentiatge again with fill = Region 
  1. the color: done via the function scale_fill_manual
  1. note that we re-order the bar by their actual values on the x-axis, via reorder(x-variable, y-variable)
-->

## Labels 

- Can make your plot clearer by adding some texts on each bar, via `geom_text()` 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightblue", colour="black") +
  geom_text(aes(label=weight), vjust=1.5, colour="black")

ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightblue", colour="black") +
  geom_text(aes(label=weight), vjust=-0.5, colour="black") + 
  ylim(0, max(pg_mean$weight) * 1.05)
```
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
x <- ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightblue", colour="black") +
  geom_text(aes(label=weight), vjust=1.5, colour="black")
y <- ggplot(pg_mean, aes(x=group, y=weight)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="lightblue", colour="black") +
  geom_text(aes(label=weight), vjust=-0.5, colour="black") + ylim(0, max(pg_mean$weight) * 1.05)
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

<!-- in geom_text(), need to 
  1. specify the source of the label, here the weight (= y-axis) 
  2. vjust helps to adjust the place of the test above or below the tops of the bar 
  
  NOTE: what have i done in the second plot? i've adjusted the limits of the y-axis so that the text that i put above the bars remains in the plot. 
  done that with y_lim 
  
Start to understand how ggplot2 works? all about sum. wanna modify a default feature: most of the time, add an element via+ 
 -->
 
## Clevevand Dot Plot 

- Simplest way to create a dot plot is with `geom_point()`
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}
ggplot(tophitters2001[1:25, ], aes(x=avg, y=name)) + geom_point()
```

<!-- 
why isn't that a nice graph?

1. the names are sorted alphabetically. why? by default, R sorts the variable the easiest way possible. here, the easiest way is alphabetical.
but don't really care; would prefer the name to be sorted by average rather than by alphabetical order 
-->

## Clevevand Dot Plot 

- Order again thanks to `reorder()`
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}
ggplot(tophitters2001[1:25, ], aes(x=avg, y=reorder(name, avg))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) + theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "grey60", linetype = "dashed"))
```

<!-- WHAT4S GOING ON?
used this graph also to change a bit the theme 
  1. increases the size of the points, easy 
  1. set the theme in black & white -- more on that later 
  1. additionally, re-mastered a bit the original theme 
    1. removed the minor and major x grid 
    1. set the major y grid lines as dashed and grey!
-->

# Line graphs

## Basic 

- Mostly used to plot a discrete or continuous variable ($y$-axis) against a continuous variable ($x$-axis)
- Similar to the previous syntax but use `geom_line()`
- Customize the line within `geom_line()`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + ylim(0, max(BOD$demand))
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + 
  geom_line(linetype = "dashed", size = 1, colour = "blue") + 
  ylim(0, max(BOD$demand))
```
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
x <- ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + ylim(0, max(BOD$demand))
y <- ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line(linetype = "dashed", size = 1, colour = "blue") + ylim(0, max(BOD$demand))
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

## Interpolation

- `ggplot2` uses linear interpolation between the points supplied
- Can be very useful to plot the data points on top of the line with `geom_point()`, that can also be customized
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + 
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 22, colour = "darkred", fill = "pink")
ggplot(worldpop, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + scale_y_log10()
```
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
x <- ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 4, shape = 22, colour = "darkred", fill = "pink")
y <- ggplot(worldpop, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + scale_y_log10()
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

## Different symbols 

![](https://i.imgur.com/67l2HSB.png)

<!-- what do you notice? 
automatically, ggplot treats the x-variable as continuous => will always linearly interpolate between the data points you are supplying it 
in the first plot, notice that for t = 6, missing data, so the observed lined might not be very accurate 
similarly in the second plot: many more points in the recent years => the line's much more accurate there than at the beginning
-->

## Multiple lines

- Can differentiate the lines with `colour`, `linetype`; if also include data points, can also use `shape` or `fill` to differentiate 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
require(plyr)
```
```{r, echo = TRUE} 
tooth <- ddply(ToothGrowth, c("supp", "dose"), summarise, length = mean(len))
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(tooth, aes(x = dose, y = length)) + geom_line()
ggplot(tooth, aes(x = dose, y = length, linetype = supp)) + geom_line()
```
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
x <- ggplot(tooth, aes(x = dose, y = length)) + geom_line()
y <- ggplot(tooth, aes(x = dose, y = length, linetype = supp)) + geom_line()
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

<!-- as we saw in the lecture on data frame, create a new data frame that takes the mean per dose and per supp of len

then plot the length against the dose; note that if we do not differentiage by supp, the plot is not as expected; reason: multiple data points at each x, and ggplot thinks they are all in one group; instead, if we differentiate them by supp, then only one data point per x 

NOTE: one of the pitfalls of ggplot. not designed to add different layers to a plot, as you would do with R basic by adding lines or points to a graph. need to do it all at once...
-->

## Shaded area

- Use `geom_area()`, with useful arguments: `colour`, `fill` and `alpha`
<!-- alpha manages the opacity of the plot-->
- Particularly useful for time series 
<!-- time series are a particular data structure in R; kinda like a vector, but also include information on the timing: the beinning, the ending and the frequency-->
```{r, echo = TRUE} 
str(sunspot.year)
attributes(sunspot.year)
sunspotyear <- data.frame(
  Year = as.numeric(time(sunspot.year)),
  Sunspots = as.numeric(sunspot.year)
)
```

## Shaded area

- Use `geom_area()`, with useful arguments: `colour`, `fill` and `alpha`
<!-- alpha manages the opacity of the plot-->
- Particularly useful for time series 
```{r, eval = FALSE} 
ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) +
  geom_area(colour="black", fill="blue", alpha=.2)
ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) +
  geom_area(fill="blue", alpha=.2) + geom_line()
```
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE} 
x <- ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) +
  geom_area(colour="black", fill="blue", alpha=.2)
y <- ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) +
  geom_area(fill="blue", alpha=.2) + geom_line()
ggarrange(x, y, nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
```

<!-- notice: nicer to not set a colour around the shaded area, and a line instead; otherwise even the bottom of the area is contoured-->

## Confidence region

- Need to do things

    1. plot the upper and lower bound 
    1. find a nice way to plot them 

- Use `geom_ribbon()` combined with `ymin` and `ymax`
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE} 
ggplot(subset(climate, Source == "Berkeley"), aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=Anomaly10y-Unc10y, ymax=Anomaly10y+Unc10y), alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_line()
```

<!-- in clim, 
1. Anomaly10y is a 10-year running average of the deviation (in
Celsius) from the average 1950–1980 temperature,
1. Unc10y is the 95% confidence interval.

Why do we add geom_line() after the ribbon? so that the line is plotted on top of the ribbon -- otherwise would not see it! -->

## Confidence region: exerice 

- **Exercice**: find an easier way, without using `geom_ribbon`, to plot the 95% CI

## Confidence region: solution 

- **Exercice**: find an easier way, without using `geom_ribbon`, to plot the 95% CI
- Solution: simply use `geom_line()`
```{r, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}
ggplot(clim, aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Anomaly10y-Unc10y), linetype="dotted") +
  geom_line(aes(y=Anomaly10y+Unc10y), linetype="dotted") +
  geom_line()
```
